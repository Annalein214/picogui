## Filterwheel: 

A motor is driven by an Arduino and its position read out with an Encoder. The motor turns a wheel with optical filters in it beneath a PMT. So the position of the filters needs to be accurately adjusted. 
Currently this is an independent program which requires independent setup, see this file.
